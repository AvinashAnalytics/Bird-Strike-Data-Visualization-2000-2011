# **Bird Strike Analysis in Aviation (2000–2011)**

## **Introduction:**
Bird strikes represent one of the most pressing safety concerns in the aviation industry. Between **2000 and 2011**, these incidents led to significant aircraft damage, costly repairs, and, in some cases, injuries to passengers and crew. In this comprehensive analysis, I’ve leveraged data to uncover key trends, pinpoint high-risk factors, and develop actionable insights aimed at improving safety and minimizing the financial burden of bird strikes.

By utilizing **Power BI**, I’ve built **interactive, dynamic dashboards** to visually represent the data—making it not only accessible but also insightful. These dashboards allow a deeper dive into factors like **species involved**, **weather conditions**, **flight phases**, and **financial impacts**. The ultimate goal? To empower aviation professionals with the knowledge needed to create **smarter, safer solutions** for bird strike prevention.

## **Data Cleaning & Preparation:**
Before diving into analysis, it was crucial to ensure the dataset was precise and ready for meaningful insights. Here’s a glimpse into the meticulous **data preparation** steps taken:

- **Data Standardization**: All column names and data formats were carefully standardized, creating a smooth and consistent foundation for analysis.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Any missing or incorrect data points were either removed or appropriately imputed, ensuring accuracy across the dataset.
- **Outlier Removal**: Extreme values, especially in **financial data** and **strike costs**, were identified and adjusted, eliminating distortions in the analysis.
- **Data Structuring**: The data was transformed into a well-organized structure, with key fields such as **species**, **year**, and **cost** made accessible for deeper exploration.

## **Key Findings & Insights:**

### **1. Total Wildlife Remains Collected:**
A total of **6,806 wildlife remains** were collected over the 11-year period, reflecting the effectiveness of wildlife management efforts at airports. This collection data is crucial for future **bird strike mitigation strategies**, as it provides valuable insights into the bird species and the effectiveness of current control measures. However, there is still room for refinement in these efforts to enhance both effectiveness and efficiency.

### **2. Effectiveness of Wildlife Remains Collection:**
**73.24%** of bird strikes resulted in wildlife remains being collected, while **26.76%** did not. This gap indicates that, although wildlife management is relatively effective, a more **comprehensive collection process** is needed to better understand bird strike patterns and ensure that prevention efforts are appropriately targeted.

### **3. Bird Strikes by Species:**
The most frequently involved species were classified as **"Unknown Bird"** types, accounting for over **10.4K incidents**. This underscores the importance of **enhancing bird species identification** at airports. By developing more precise species monitoring systems, airports can implement **targeted control measures** and reduce the risks associated with specific bird types.

### **4. Bird Strikes by Aircraft Size:**
An interesting finding emerged when analyzing the data based on aircraft size: **33.04%** of bird strikes occurred with **Large Aircraft**, while **Small Aircraft** accounted for **66.96%** of strikes. While large aircraft often experience more serious damage due to bird strikes, **small aircraft** are more frequently affected. This suggests that mitigation strategies should be adapted based on aircraft size, with a focus on **preventive measures for smaller aircraft**.

### **5. Bird Strikes and Weather Conditions:**
Bird strike incidents often correlate with **rain** and **snow**, which can alter bird behaviors and increase their presence near airports. With this in mind, **weather-based bird monitoring systems** can be crucial in mitigating risks. Airports could greatly benefit from **real-time monitoring systems** that specifically track bird activity during inclement weather conditions, providing a better means of prevention.

### **6. Bird Strikes Involving Pilot Warning:**
**42.72%** of bird strikes occurred **with pilot warnings**, while **57.28%** happened without any prior warning to pilots. This suggests a critical gap in early warning systems, and a clear opportunity for improvement. **Enhanced, real-time bird strike notification systems** could drastically reduce the occurrence of strikes by giving pilots enough time to take preventative actions.

### **7. Total Number of People Injured:**
Despite the large number of bird strikes, the study recorded **only 21 injuries** over the 11-year period. While relatively low, this statistic highlights the importance of continuously improving safety measures to prevent even **minor injuries** from escalating. A more effective bird strike mitigation system could help drive this number even lower.

## **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

To measure the success of bird strike mitigation efforts, I tracked the following **KPIs**:

1. **Total Bird Strikes**: A vital KPI, this metric provides a clear picture of the frequency of bird strikes over time, enabling a better understanding of the effectiveness of mitigation strategies and identifying emerging trends.
   
2. **Number of Injuries**: This KPI measures the impact of bird strikes on human safety—assessing how well current measures are preventing injuries to passengers, crew, and ground personnel.
   
3. **Financial Impact**: The **financial cost** of bird strikes—including aircraft damage, repairs, and delays—was tracked to assess the economic burden of these incidents on airlines and the aviation industry at large. Understanding this impact helps make a case for further investments in bird strike prevention strategies.

## **Visualizing the Data:**
To bring the data to life, I created **three powerful dashboards** in **Power BI**, each designed to offer an interactive and dynamic view of bird strike data:

1. **Dashboard 1: Species Analysis & Identification**
   - This dashboard highlights the breakdown of bird species involved in strikes, with a particular focus on the **"Unknown Bird"** category, allowing users to explore trends in species identification.

2. **Dashboard 2: Weather and Flight Phase Impact**
   - This dashboard visualizes the correlation between **weather conditions** (like rain and snow) and the frequency of bird strikes. It also displays the phase of flight during which strikes are most likely to occur, helping to pinpoint critical moments for preventive action.

3. **Dashboard 3: Aircraft Size & Financial Impact**
   - A breakdown of bird strikes by **aircraft size**, paired with a comprehensive view of the **financial costs** of these incidents, providing a direct comparison between small and large aircraft and the financial implications of bird strikes.

These dashboards make the data not only easier to understand but also more accessible, empowering aviation professionals to make data-driven decisions to improve safety and reduce bird strike risks.

## **Conclusion:**
This in-depth analysis of bird strikes between **2000 and 2011** offers critical insights into the underlying causes of these incidents. The data highlights key patterns, such as species involvement, weather conditions, and aircraft size—each of which plays a significant role in determining the frequency and severity of bird strikes. 

By utilizing the findings from this analysis, aviation professionals and airport management teams can make more informed decisions and take **actionable steps** toward enhancing bird strike prevention strategies. Whether through **improving early warning systems**, **targeted species management**, or **weather-based monitoring**, there’s immense potential to make aviation safer and more cost-effective.
