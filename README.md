# 🛩️ Bird Strike Analysis in Aviation (2000–2011)  
**Authored, Analyzed, and Visualized by [AVINASH RAI]**  
*An End-to-End Project: From Raw Data to Actionable Insights*  

---

## 🌍 Introduction  
Bird strikes pose a critical safety and financial challenge in aviation, causing **$1.2B+ in annual damages** globally. This project analyzes **FAA data (2000–2011)** to uncover trends, risks, and mitigation strategies.  

### 🎯 **Key Objectives**  
- Identify high-risk factors (species, weather, flight phases).  
- Quantify financial and safety impacts.  
- Build interactive dashboards for stakeholder decision-making.

## 🔑 Key Findings & Insights  

### 🦴 **1. Wildlife Remains & Species**  
- **6,806 remains** collected (73.24% success rate).  
- **Gap**: 26.76% of strikes lacked remains → *Improve tracking systems*.  
- **10,400+ strikes** involved *unknown birds* → **AI-powered species recognition** needed.  

### ✈️ **2. Aircraft & Flight Phases**  
- **Small Aircraft**: 66.96% of strikes (*higher frequency*).  
- **Large Aircraft**: 33.04% of strikes (*higher damage severity*).  
- **87% of strikes** occurred below **1,000 ft** during takeoff/landing.  

### 🌧️ **3. Weather & Pilot Alerts**  
- **Rain/Snow**: Increased strikes due to altered bird behavior.  
- **57.28% of strikes** occurred *without pilot warnings* → Upgrade real-time alert systems.  

### 📉 **4. Financial & Safety Impact**  
- **Total Cost**: $142M (2000–2011).  
- **Injuries**: 21 (*near-zero but preventable*).

## 🎯 Recommendations  
1. **Altitude Monitoring**: Focus on takeoff/landing phases (87% of strikes below 1,000 ft).  
2. **Species ID Tech**: Deploy AI tools like the [AirBirds dataset](https://airbirdsdata.github.io/).  
3. **Weather-Responsive Systems**: Use radar during rain/snow (e.g., Seattle-Tacoma Airport’s 10-mile detection).  
4. **Pilot Alerts**: Integrate thermal cameras for real-time warnings.  
5. **Cost Control**: Invest in airport wildlife management programs.
