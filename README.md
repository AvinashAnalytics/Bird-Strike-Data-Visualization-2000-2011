# **Project Overview: Bird Strike Analysis in Aviation (2000–2011)**

## **Introduction:**
As part of this project, I conducted a detailed **analysis of bird strikes** in the aviation industry between **2000 and 2011**. Bird strikes are a significant safety concern in aviation, causing potential damage to aircraft, financial loss, and, in some cases, injury or loss of life. By analyzing the dataset, I aimed to **identify trends**, **understand contributing factors**, and provide actionable insights that can aid in **bird strike mitigation**.

I used **Power BI** to build dynamic **interactive dashboards** that allow for in-depth exploration of various factors such as **species involved**, **weather conditions**, **flight phases**, and **financial impacts**. These insights are aimed at enhancing aviation safety and reducing bird strike incidents.

## **Project Cleaning & Data Preparation:**
Before diving into the analysis, I performed several **data cleaning** steps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the dataset:

1. **Data Standardization**: I standardized the column names and data formats to ensure consistency across all records.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing or incorrect values were handled by removing or imputing them where applicable.
3. **Outlier Removal**: Outliers in certain columns, such as **cost data**, were identified and adjusted to ensure they did not distort the analysis.
4. **Data Transformation**: I transformed the data into a **structured format** that is easy to work with, ensuring all necessary columns (e.g., **year**, **species**, **cost**) were included.

## **Findings & Insights:**

### **1. Total Wildlife Remains Collected**
- **6,806 wildlife remains** were collected, which gives us insight into the success of wildlife management efforts at airports. This collection can inform better strategies for bird control and mitigation.

### **2. Effectiveness of Wildlife Remains Collection**
- **73.24%** of bird strikes had wildlife remains collected, while **26.76%** did not. This indicates that efforts in wildlife remains collection are relatively effective, but there is room for improvement.

### **3. Bird Strikes by Species**
- The most commonly involved species were **"Unknown Bird"** types, accounting for **10.4K incidents**. This highlights the need for better identification and targeted control measures for specific bird species at airports.

### **4. Bird Strikes by Aircraft Size**
- **Large Aircraft** accounted for **33.04%** of bird strikes, while **Small Aircraft** accounted for **66.96%**. This shows that although large aircraft are more vulnerable, small aircraft experience a higher frequency of strikes.

### **5. Bird Strikes and Weather Conditions**
- The correlation between weather conditions and bird strikes revealed that **rain** and **snow** are often associated with bird strikes. Airports may benefit from enhanced bird monitoring systems during **inclement weather** conditions.

### **6. Bird Strikes Involving Pilot Warning**
- **42.72%** of bird strikes occurred with **pilot warnings**, and **57.28%** occurred without warnings. This suggests the need for improved early warning systems to notify pilots in real time.

### **7. Total Number of People Injured**
- **21 injuries** were recorded due to bird strikes over the study period. This number is relatively low but indicates the importance of continuing to refine safety procedures.

## **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

To measure the success of bird strike mitigation efforts, I focused on three primary KPIs:

1. **Total Bird Strikes**: This KPI tracks the total number of bird strikes over time, highlighting any significant increase or decrease in bird strike incidents.
   
2. **Number of Injuries**: This KPI measures the total number of injuries caused by bird strikes, helping assess the safety impact on passengers and crew.
   
3. **Financial Impact**: This KPI calculates the total costs associated with bird strikes, providing insight into the financial burden these incidents have on airlines and the aviation industry.

## **Conclusion:**
Through this project, I was able to uncover valuable insights into the causes and impacts of bird strikes in aviation. The **data visualizations** I created highlight key factors like **species involved**, **weather conditions**, and the **phase of flight** during which strikes occur. These findings can help **aviation professionals** and **airport management** improve safety protocols and develop more effective **bird strike prevention** strategies.
